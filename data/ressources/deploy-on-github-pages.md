# Deploy on Github Pages

If you host your project on Github, it is possible to make it available with Github Pages.

Telecope comes with a pre-made command that allows you to automatically deploy the project.

```
npm run deploy
```

Once deployed, the site will be visible at the URL: https://`username`.github.io/`project-name`/
