# Telescope's philosophy

Unlike a wiki where the pages have a hierarchy. In Telescope, we add cards in which we add the content.
Each card is structured in a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) file to define its metadata. This will be used to generate the static HTML pages.

The resources are the main cards that are used to generate the graph.

The metadata will allow you to link your resources together on the graph.
